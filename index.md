		<h1>50 Years of Terrorism</h1>
	</header>


<h2 id="content">Abstract</h2>
<p> Terrorism is a subject largely covered in the media, and, unfortunately, we became accustomed to its presence worldwide, particularly over the last decade. Nevertheless, the problem we are facing today is not new. The source of certain conflicts dates from multiple decades, some of which are still lasting today. Our goal is to track and vizualize terrorism evolution through the past 50 years based on The Global Terrorism Database. There are many questions we can ask ourselves about terrorism, such as "Is EU less safe nowadays ?", "Did attack mediums & reasons change over the years ?" or "Can we discriminate current/future conflictual zones ?". It would be presumptuous from us to say that we are going to solve major issues, or even predict futur attacks. However, through the exploration of the dataset, and by trying to answer those interrogations, we aim to grasp an overview and a better understanding to the evolution of terrorism.</p>
